# Techno-Economic Parameter Calibration: Poland to Austria

## Overview
This document details the adaptation of techno-economic parameters from the Polish case study (Benalcazar et al., 2024) to the Austrian context.

## Base Parameters (Poland)
- hardware_cost_eur_kw: 545.6
- project_lifetime_years: 25
- discount_rate_percent: 5.92
- o_and_m_percent: 1.0

## Calibrated Parameters (Austria)
- hardware_cost_eur_kw: 844.6
- project_lifetime_years: 25
- discount_rate_percent: 4.5
- o_and_m_percent: 1.2

## Key Changes
- discount_rate: 5.92% → 4.5%
- hardware_costs: 545.6 → 844.6 €/kW
- o_and_m: 1.0% → 1.2%

## Calibration Methodology
### Discount Rate
- Nominal rate: 7.85%
- Real rate: 2.35%
- Calibrated rate: 4.5%
- Method: WACC-based with Austrian economic indicators

### Hardware Costs
- Global average (2022): 820.0 €/kW
- Austria adjusted: 844.6 €/kW
- Adjustment: +3.0%
- Source: IRENA 2022 + Austrian market premium

### O&M Costs
- European range: 1.0-1.5%
- Austria estimate: 1.2%
- Justification: European average adjusted for Austrian labor costs
