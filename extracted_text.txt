LCOE ABSTRACT  
Solar photovoltaic capacities have experienced remarkable gains worldwide. The accelerated deployment of 
photovoltaic (PV) systems has emphasized the need for methods and tools that can assist in planning and in-
vestment decisions of utility-scale photovoltaic systems to ensure a sustainable energy transition. This study 
bridges the gap between research and current solar PV project evaluation practices by proposing a geographic 
information system (GIS)-based approach for analyzing land eligibility and performing techno-economic as-
sessments of utility-scale photovoltaic systems. To tackle the issue of country-specific cost elements, the model 
incorporates a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) breakdown often used by governmental and intergovernmental 
organizations. The proposed GIS-based model can assist in mapping the distribution of eligible land for utility- 
scale solar systems while considering exclusion constraints, estimating PV capacity and generation potentials, as 
well as determining the average LCOE of utility-scale solar photovoltaic systems at a spatial resolution of 100 m. 
The GIS-based approach is demonstrated through the case study of Poland. The model estimates that 3.61% of 
the total area of Poland is suitable for the installation of utility-scale solar PV systems. Implementing PV in-
stallations in these areas would result in solar capacities ranging from 394.64 to 563.77 GW. Furthermore, the 
findings of the case study indicate that the LCOE would range from €0.043/kWh to €0.049/kWh, with a national 
average of €0.045/kWh. The proposed approach can be utilized to develop national and regional strategies 
focused on large-scale PV installations, facilitating the attainment of renewable energy goals. The study fills a 
significant gap in the literature as it provides a GIS-based tool for planning the sustainable development of 
utility-scale PV systems at the regional scale. In addition, it is the first to comprehensively assess the capacity and 
generation potential of utility-scale solar photovoltaics in Poland at the NUTS-2 level.   
1.Introduction 
Solar energy has emerged as a crucial renewable source for 
combatting climate change, decarbonizing power systems, and sup-
porting sustainable economic growth [1,2]. Due to the vast solar 
resource potential in different countries, as well as the rapid technological advancement and cost decline of photovoltaic modules, 
utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) capacities have seen remarkable gains 
worldwide —particularly among developed economies like the United 
States, Australia, and Western Europe [3,4]. However, it is only recently 
that utility-scale solar installations have become economically acces -
sible to developing regions and are more frequently considered critical 
technologies for fostering the energy transition [5,6]. Utility-scale

2systems, which differ in size and capacity from residential and com-
mercial photovoltaic systems, are widely employed today in urban and 
rural areas to convert solar energy into electricity [7]. Typically, utility- 
scale systems are classified as those with capacities greater than 5 MW. 
In contrast, residential PV systems usually have capacities ranging from 
4 kW to 10 kW, while commercial systems fall within the range of 100 
kW to 5 MW [8,9]. 
Site selection for deploying utility-scale photovoltaic systems re-
quires detailed information about solar irradiation and meteorological 
conditions of a region or specific location and a comprehensive assess -
ment of land availability and land cover characteristics [10]. Research 
on spatial and spatio-temporal modeling of renewable energy technol -
ogies has gained momentum in recent years. This growing interest is 
partly driven by the advancements in computational power, remote 
sensing, earth-bound survey, and cartography, which have given rise to 
integrated mapping tools commonly referred to as Geographic Infor-
mation Systems (GIS) [11]. These powerful computational tools have 
become critical for making sound planning and investment decisions 
since they simultaneously consider temporal and spatial information 
about a region/location, represented either as a vector (points, lines, and 
polygons) or raster data (point features by single —pixel— cells in a two- 
dimensional matrix). Geographic information systems typically 
comprise four main components: hardware (computers for data pro-
cessing), software (programs and applications), GIS professionals (skil-
led individuals capable of interpreting the results), and a GIS 
organizational environment (supporting GIS training, data collection, 
and dissemination) [12]. Furthermore, the elements of GIS can be 
categorized into geospatial data, data acquisition and management, data 
display, data exploration, and data analysis [12]. Despite the increasing 
need for spatio-temporal analysis of renewable energy sources, 
computational approaches that facilitate the systematic investigation of 
solar resource potential, land use, and bankability of utility-scale 
photovoltaic systems remain scarce in the literature. 
Most research works use simulation and/or optimization models at 
the individual plant level to solve the complex problem of planning and 
development of utility-scale photovoltaic systems. For example, Shakeel 
and Mokheimer evaluated the levelized cost of electricity of utility-scale 
solar PV plants in 40 cities in Saudi Arabia using the simulation software 
System Advisor Model (SAM) [13]. Sreenath et al. conducted an energy, 
exergy, economic, and environmental analysis of a conceptual 5 MW 
utility-scale solar photovoltaic power plant using RETScreen and an 
Excel-based mathematical model [14]. Similarly, Kumar et al. developed 
a techno-economic model to evaluate the performance of a 10 MWp 
grid-connected canal-top PV plant in India [15]. Mensah et al. investigated the performance of a 2.5 MW solar photovoltaic power 
plant at a specific site in Ghana [16]. The study assessed the final energy 
output, capacity factor, and levelized cost of electricity of the grid- 
connected PV system. The tools mentioned above are commonly used 
to investigate the techno-economics of the system under various sce-
narios. However, they do not necessarily address the problem of iden-
tifying feasible deployment sites within large amounts of land. Hence, 
GIS-based studies have shown great promise in evaluating and select -
ing ideal locations for wind and photovoltaic systems. 
Among the recent studies that have focused on the land eligibility of 
renewable energy systems using GIS-based models, the work by Ryberg 
et al. is noteworthy. It evaluated thirty-six commonly used land eligi-
bility constraints in the European context and ranked their significance 
based on independence, exclusivity, and overlap [17]. The results 
showed that the criterion of proximity to agriculture and woodland 
areas is among the most important, whereas airports and camping sites 
rank low in significance. Alhamwi et al. conducted an analysis of GIS- 
based urban energy systems models and their applications in cities 
[18]. The results demonstrated that GIS-based platforms that consider 
special features of urban objects are useful for the flexibilization of 
technologies, including wind, solar, and storage units. 
Spatio-temporal modeling has found a wide range of applications in 
urban and smart city planning, wind and solar farm site selection, and 
the quantification of renewable energy technical potentials. Camargo 
et al. proposed a GIS-based method to improve the decision-making 
process for deploying solar photovoltaic panels [19]. Pea Sanchez 
et al. carried out a techno-economical assessment of wind (onshore and 
offshore) and photovoltaic (open-field and rooftop) systems in Mexico 
and assessed their installable potential by 2050 [20]. In the study, the 
authors conducted a land eligibility analysis that incorporated 34 land 
constraints, including physical, economic, environmental, and socio -
political exclusion criteria. In addition to the aforementioned land 
eligibility criteria, the authors applied seven exclusion constraints spe-
cific to Mexico: military areas, harbors, liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
terminals, geothermal sites, primary jungles, active volcanos, and hur-
ricanes. A notable contribution of their study was the evaluation of the 
installable potential of renewable technologies and the levelized cost of 
electricity for each technology. Similarly, Watson and Hudson con-
ducted a land eligibility analysis to assess the potential of wind and solar 
production in South-Central England [21]. The constraints applied in 
the study were agricultural lands, historically important areas, land-
scape designations, residential areas, slope, and wildlife designations. 
The results showed that environmental constraints account for over 60% 
of the area available for wind and solar technologies. Nomenclature

3Recent research efforts have begun to direct more attention to esti-
mating renewable energy potentials using GIS-based models. Cheng 
et al. carried out a GIS-based assessment of the technical and economic 
resource potential of solar photovoltaic, wind, and pumped hydro in 
Bolivia [22]. The study considered terrain slope and other factors like 
proximity to major roads, protected areas, urban centers, lakes, and 
rivers as essential exclusion criteria. In a more recent study, Cheng et al. 
conducted a renewable resource assessment for Japan [23]. The evalu -
ation considered resource constraints and used an optimization model to 
find the power system configuration that would meet the power demand 
only with renewable energy sources. Fatima-Zahra et al. performed a 
techno-economic assessment of solar PV resources in Morocco using a 
GIS-based method [24]. The authors conducted a scenario analysis and 
examined the levelized cost of electricity considering the weather con-
ditions and terrain constraints. Asare-Addo analyzed land eligibility for 
large-scale or utility grid-connected solar PV systems in Ghana [25]. The 
results indicate that about 85% of the total land area in Ghana is suitable 
for solar systems deployment. Doorga et al. provided a GIS-based 
assessment for identifying optimum wind and solar sites in Africa to 
face the challenges related to decarbonization [26]. The spatio-temporal 
analysis revealed that Egypt and South Africa are the most favorable 
locations for deploying renewable generation units. 
Compared to other studies, Samsatli et al. proposed an optimization 
model that incorporated land eligibility constraints [27]. The model 
focused on wind‑hydrogen-electricity networks with the objective of 
satisfying domestic transport demands. The authors considered the 
spatial distribution and temporal variability of energy demands as well 
as wind availability in Great Britain. The study applied technical and 
environmental land constraints, including distance from urban areas, 
rivers, roads, woodland, and others. Welder et al. developed a spatio- 
temporal optimization model of onshore wind technology for power- 
to‑hydrogen applications in Germany [28]. The authors applied land 
eligibility, weather constraints, and turbine data to develop regional 
power profiles. Three types of exclusion criteria were used to investigate 
the deployment of wind turbines: physically limiting land cover char-
acteristics, policy and societal preferences, and observation of protected 
areas. 
The studies reviewed above point to a number of gaps in the litera -
ture regarding the geospatial modeling of renewable energy systems 
(RES) and show that to successfully implement large-scale RES projects, 
both spatial features of the region/area of interest and sociotechnical 
criteria must be thoroughly explored. Furthermore, previous research 
efforts indicate that country-dependent cost elements significantly in-
fluence the economics of utility-scale solar photovoltaic systems. This is 
particularly relevant in countries where fossil fuels are the main energy 
vectors, and the competitiveness of RES systems is primarily impacted 
by local installation, hardware, and soft costs. Thus, this study aims to 
bridge the gap between research and current solar PV project evaluation 
practices by facilitating the identification of suitable sites and the 
assessment of economic potential with the use of a GIS-based model that 
pays special consideration to the variation in the levelized cost of elec-
tricity due to labor-related costs like PV system installation, mechanical 
and electrical installation, and other expenditures. 
The scope of this study is focused on examining utility-scale solar PV 
installations in both urban and rural settings, with a particular emphasis 
on ground fixed-tilt solar PV systems. These systems have been selected 
due to their significant presence in developed and developing markets 
[29,30], as well as their cost-effectiveness (lower installation and 
maintenance costs) and durability when compared to tracking systems 
[31]. Rooftop installations are excluded from the analysis due to the 
unique context in Poland and other European countries, where solar 
panels mounted on residential and commercial rooftops frequently 
benefit from compensation mechanisms and various financial 
incentives. 
Despite the considerable advancements introduced towards the 
development of GIS-based tools for planning and modeling renewable energy systems, to the best of the authors ’ knowledge, no study has 
established a GIS-based method that comprehensively breaks down the 
techno-economic factors that affect the levelized cost of electricity of 
utility-scale solar PV systems —such factors are imperative for a better 
understanding of cost drivers — and considers the impact of geospatial 
factors on the feasibility of their large-scale deployment. Moreover, 
while there is an increasing interest in implementing large-scale solar PV 
systems in Europe, no prior research has examined the land eligibility 
and potential spatial distribution of utility-scale PV systems in Poland at 
the NUTS-2 level. Therefore, this paper aims to address these gaps by (i) 
proposing an innovative method for analyzing land eligibility, instal -
lable capacity, solar energy potential, and performing techno-economic 
assessments of utility-scale photovoltaic systems and (ii) testing its 
effectiveness through the geospatial analysis of the Polish territory and 
its 17 NUTS-2 regions. 
It is worth noting that Poland is an important case study since it has 
one of the highest carbon intensities of electricity in Europe and has 
experienced substantial growth in solar PV capacity in the last four 
years, accounting for approximately 18% of the country ’s total installed 
capacity. Moreover, only one study has explored the research problem of 
the spatial, temporal, and cost distribution of renewable technologies in 
Poland. However, the work focused on potential areas for the deploy -
ment of wind power. Sliz-Szkliniarz et al. developed a spatio-temporal 
distribution model which applied technical, environmental, economic, 
and social acceptance criteria to assess the potential levelized cost of 
electricity generated by wind farms [32]. 
In this context, the key contributions of this study can be summarized 
as follows:  
≡Firstly, a GIS-based method is proposed for analyzing land eligibility 
and performing techno-economic assessments of utility-scale 
photovoltaic systems. The main novelty of this method lies in its 
ability to account for variations in the levelized cost of electricity due 
to labor-related costs such as PV system installation, mechanical and 
electrical installation, and other expenditures while considering 
sociotechnical criteria that may limit the deployment of utility-scale 
PV systems in certain areas.  
≡Secondly, the study offers a unique tool for assessing both installable 
capacity and electricity production potential of utility-scale solar 
photovoltaics at high spatial resolutions. The GIS-based tool also 
enables the computation of the levelized cost of electricity by 
applying techno-economic parameters of solar PV systems and land 
constraints from open and publicly available datasets. Additionally, 
it identifies the regions with the most significant potential for job 
creation associated with utility-scale PV installations.  
≡Thirdly, the paper presents valuable findings on installable capacity 
and electricity generation potential at a resolution of 100 m for 
Polish NUTS-2 regions, providing insight into the opportunities and 
costs associated with utility-solar PV systems. The results can assist 
policymakers and local governments in better planning and allo-
cating funds, as well as designing support mechanisms for such in-
vestments to fulfill climate goals related to increased renewable 
capacity. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes the GIS-based model developed for the analysis of land eligibility 
and the techno-economic assessment of utility-scale photovoltaic sys-
tems. Section 3 defines the case study and the main techno-economic 
assumptions adopted. Section 4 presents the results of the land eligi-
bility and techno-economic assessments of utility-scale photovoltaic 
systems, including the installable potential and levelized cost of elec-
tricity. Finally, section 5 draws conclusions about the method and the 
potential deployment of utility-scale PV systems. P. Benalcazar et al.

42.Method 
This section presents the method for analyzing land eligibility and 
performing techno-economic assessments of utility-scale photovoltaic 
systems. The method is designed for spatio-temporal scientific compu -
tations aimed at investigating the suitability of a region/site for the 
potential deployment of utility-scale photovoltaic systems and esti-
mating the levelized cost of electricity of such installations in the 
selected sites. 
A visual representation of the approach is illustrated in Fig. 1. The 
method proposed in this paper, denoted as SILICON (SpatIo-temporaL 
scIentific ComputatiONs), facilitates computations at a spatial resolu -
tion of 100 m. In the initial step (Step 1), the entire land area of the 
country is transformed into matrices with rows and columns containing 
cell values representing categorical and numerical data. Subsequently 
(Step 2), datasets encompassing geometries and attributes of diverse 
objects are employed to identify eligible land (available sites) within 
each cell. To accomplish this, various land exclusion constraints are 
taken into consideration to evaluate the available land and assess the 
installable and generation potential of utility-scale solar PV systems. 
Once the eligible land is identified, the method proceeds to estimate the 
levelized cost of electricity in each cell (Step 3). This estimation in-
corporates local techno-economic parameters of renewable energy 
technologies, including both capital and operational costs, as well as the 
electricity produced over the lifetime of the solar PV installation. 
2.1. GIS-based model 
Geographic information systems are advanced tools used to explore 
and analyze maps and terrain features. They also enable the creation of 
spatially explicit models capable of separating or categorizing areas 
based on a set of selection criteria. Furthermore, GIS systems can be 
integrated with advanced methods that are capable of performing 
mathematical operations on data primitives describing geographical 
phenomena like points, lines, polygons, and pixels. These data types are 
typically stored in different geographical database structures, such as 
raster and vector datasets [11,33]. In recent years, there has been an 
increasing interest in developing new theoretical concepts and decision- 
support tools capable of estimating the amount and distribution of land 
available for the deployment of renewable energy technologies. Due to 
the significant decline in solar PV module prices, utility-scale solar has 
become a competitive option for expanding power capacity while 
reducing fossil fuel dependence and potentially substituting traditional 
fossil-based power plants. However, to guarantee the successful imple -
mentation of utility-scale solar, it is essential to develop effective evaluations of land eligibility, policies, and physically limiting attributes 
of regions of interest. 
In this context, this study proposes a computational method for (1) 
mapping the distribution of eligible land for large-scale solar systems 
considering exclusion constraints, (2) estimating the installable solar 
power potential of a region of interest using geographic information 
systems, and (3) determining the average levelized cost of electricity 
from utility-scale fixed-tilt solar photovoltaic systems. 
The computational method proposed in this study builds upon the 
land-eligibility model previously developed by Ryberg et al. [17,34]. 
This method offers a more comprehensive approach by considering 
geospatially constrained eligible land and providing a detailed break -
down of techno-economic factors that impact the levelized cost of 
electricity of utility-scale photovoltaics. These factors include land use 
efficiency, installation, soft, and hardware costs. The proposed method 
aims to bridge the gap between research and current solar PV project 
evaluation practices by facilitating the identification of suitable sites and 
the assessment of economic potential. 
The method comprises two main modules: one dedicated to the 
analysis of land eligibility and the other focused on techno-economic 
assessment of utility-scale photovoltaics. An overview of the method 
developed in this study is presented in Fig. 2. In the first module, 
depending on the structure of the databases, different procedures are 
executed. In the case of vector datasets, geometries are either expanded 
through the application of a buffer or converted into a raster format. For 
raster datasets, map pixels representing the geographic extent of the 
country are assigned binary values (‘true ’ or ‘false ’). Subsequently, ex-
clusions pertaining to the availability of land are applied to indicate 
buffer distances and land specifications. The output of the first module is 
a land indication matrix that represents the available land suitable for 
the installation of utility-scale PV solar systems. A comprehensive 
description of the procedural steps involved in the land eligibility 
analysis module can be found in Section 2.1.1 . 
In the second module, the land indication matrix is overlaid with 
rasterized datasets that describe solar resources and techno-economic 
parameters of solar photovoltaic systems. These digitized maps are 
utilized to calculate the installable capacity and energy potential for 
each cell. Moreover, they are essential for computing the levelized cost 
of energy for each cell, which represents the final output of the second 
module within the SILICON model. A detailed procedure for the PV 
techno-economic analysis is further described in Section 2.1.2 . 
2.1.1. Land eligibility method 
As concerns over climate change continue to rise, there is an urgent 
need to reduce fossil fuel consumption and decarbonize the global 
Fig. 1.Scheme of the method.  P. Benalcazar et al.

5economy. In response, researchers have begun to utilize advanced 
computational tools to evaluate criteria and uncertainties that signifi -
cantly affect the distribution of large-scale renewable-based power 
generation systems. Recent studies suggest that to ensure the successful implementation of large-scale RES projects, the spatial characteristics of 
the region/area, as well as the application of sociotechnical criteria, 
must be thoroughly investigated [17,40]. 
Consequently, various land eligibility (LE) analyses have been

Benalcazar et al.

6conducted for countries that are at the forefront of the global solar 
market (i.e., Germany, the United States, China, and others) [28,41]. 
Nonetheless, the literature review indicates a research gap regarding 
land eligibility analyses and solar energy potential assessments with a 
detailed breakdown of factors that drive the levelized cost of electricity 
(LCOE) in utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. To overcome this 
deficit in the literature, this study develops a GIS-based approach that 
integrates an LCOE breakdown commonly used by governmental and 
intergovernmental organizations —since such institutions often priori -
tize simplicity and ease of access to pertinent data. Although the pro-
posed method can be applied in various contexts and regions, this study 
exhibits its versatility by evaluating the Polish territory at the NUTS-2 
level. 
To determine the land area available for utility-scale solar in-
stallations within the 17 Polish NUTS-2 regions, several vector and 
raster-based geodatabases were preprocessed and transformed using the 
open-source software QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System). 
The land eligibility analysis consists of several key steps: initialization 
and region definition, data processing, exclusion indication, application, 
and finalization. In the initial step, the spatial reference system (SRS), 
output resolution (OR) and geographical area of interest are defined. 
The GLAES model divides the geographical space into discrete spatial 
units creating a Boolean map (also known as a raster dataset or region 
mask) with the specified spatial reference system and pixel resolution. In 
the second step, the exclusions datasets (either in vector or raster 
format) are clipped and processed to ensure that they match the reso-
lution and spatial reference system of the region mask. In the third and 
fourth steps, the exclusion datasets are converted to Boolean matrices, 
and then the exclusion procedure is applied to the region mask. The 
Boolean matrices indicate whether a pixel is available or excluded, 
essentially filtering the pixels based on the exclusion criteria. This pro-
cess generates an intermediate Boolean raster. The procedure is applied 
iteratively until the final availability matrix is populated with 1 and 
0 values, indicating the exclusion or availability of the geographical 
area. In the final step, the matrix is stored in a raster-type file format that 
can be displayed or rendered as a map. A comprehensive description of 
this process can be found in [34]. 
The operations for determining land eligibility, considering socio -
technical criteria (exclusion constraints), were carried out using the 
Python programming language and the library GDAL (Geospatial Data 
Abstraction Library) [42], along with an adapted version of the open- 
source software GLAES (Geospatial Land Availability for Energy Sys-
tems) [17]. In recent years, a significant number of publications conducting land 
eligibility analyses have proposed and adopted numerous exclusion 
constraints based on local and international social, political, technical, 
economic, and conservation considerations [43–46]. However, results 
from the works of [17,47–49] have demonstrated that the selection and 
application of various socio-technical constraints related to the 
deployment of renewable energy technologies can have a substantial 
impact on the eligible area, leading to significantly different assess -
ments. Furthermore, the recent scientific debate between Enevoldsen 
et al. ([50,51]) and McKenna et al. ([52]) has highlighted the critical 
need for comprehensive evaluations of land eligibility constraints at 
local, regional, and international levels. Such evaluations should enable 
the replication of studies and facilitate the relative comparison of re-
sults. Therefore, the land constraints adopted in this study were derived 
from peer-reviewed works conducted by Ryberg et al. [17], Risch et al. 
[53], and Welder et al. [28]. These studies indicate a consensus on the 
most impactful constraints found in literature, corresponding to four 
criteria (i.e., sociopolitical, physical, conservation and economical) that 
can be uniformly imposed across the European landscape. It is worth 
noting that the study by Ryberg et al. [17] reviewed 53 publications 
centered on land eligibility analyses to determine the most commonly 
used constraints. As a result, the present study incorporates 20 of the 
most frequent and impactful constraints indicated by [17] from the re-
view of 53 land eligibility analyses, as shown in Table 1. For additional 
information on the methodology for criteria identification, readers are 
directed to the comprehensive studies presented in [17,28,40]. 
2.1.2. Techno-economic assessment 
The land availability analysis yields valuable insights into the po-
tential of utility-scale solar PV projects while considering sociotechnical 
criteria that may limit their implementation in certain areas. The 
derived findings can subsequently be used to assess the economic 
viability of these installations across various regions, taking into account 
local infrastructure, meteorological characteristics, and land attributes 
[55]. For this purpose, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a metric 
commonly used to examine and compare the cost-effectiveness of 
renewable energy projects [56,57]. The LCOE is defined as the selling 
price of electricity required to achieve the economic break-even of the 
project [58]. Additionally, the LCOE is a standard metric used for 
analyzing power generation projects and represents the ratio of total 
lifetime costs and total lifetime energy production [59]. The LCOE is also 
utilized to compare the economic viability of projects and facilitate the 
decision-making process of policymakers, businesses, and other

7stakeholders [60]. 
Considering the above, the present study aims to analyze the LCOE of 
utility-scale solar PV systems by utilizing the land eligibility results 
obtained from the first module of the SILICON model (described in 
Section 2.1.1 ). Unlike previous studies that have estimated the LCOE of a 
particular region based only on the assessment of resource potential, this 
study integrates an innovative approach that addresses the problem of 
country-dependent cost elements by breaking down the lifetime cost of 
production into installation, soft and hardware costs. This approach 
allows for the incorporation of different parameter settings for utility- 
scale solar investments in a specific region or country, enabling the 
comparison of the competitiveness of such installations with a high 
spatial resolution (100 m). Consequently, the computational method 
developed in this paper accounts for the variation in the levelized cost of 
electricity due to labor-related costs like PV system installation, me-
chanical and electrical installation, and other expenditures. 
The calculations of the LCOE for utility-scale solar systems rely on 
the approach developed by Lugo-Laguna et al. [61], which allows for the 
allocation of labor-related costs linked to site inspection, type of solar 
tracking system technology, electrical and mechanical installation, to 
the levelized cost of electricity. As indicated in Eq. (1), the LCOE of a 
project is composed of two cost components: capital expenditures 
(CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX). These two components 
are known to differ substantially over the world due to economic, de-
mographic, and technological factors [62]. 
LCOECAPEXOPEX
Lifetime Energy Production(1) 
Although various studies have indicated that solar PV is one of the 
most cost-competitive renewable technologies commercially, capital 
expenditures in utility-scale solar installations exhibit significant vari-
ations [63]. Some of these variations have been attributed to PV cell and 
panel production costs [64] and the manufacturing costs of inverters 
[61]. However, a substantial share of the cost variation in solar PV 
projects is also due to changes in installation and soft costs [61]. 
In Eq. (2), capital expenditures are decomposed into (a) hardware 
costs H(which include modules, inverters, racking and mounting, 
cabling/wiring, safety and security, monitoring and control installation 
costs), (b) soft costs SC(which include margin, financing costs, system 
design, permitting, incentive application, customer acquisition costs), 
(c) installation costs I0(which include mechanical installation, elec-
trical installation, and inspection costs) [63]. Taking into account that 
hardware costs often account for 66% of the total CAPEX [65], in Eq. (2), 
soft development and installation costs are expressed as a function of 
hardware costs and the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF). 
The annual operation expenditures of the project are defined as a 
fraction of the installation costs, as shown in Eq. (3), where θ is the 
fraction that represents the yearly operating and maintenance costs and 
I0 stands for the installation costs [61].

The Capital Recovery Factor (CRF) is a common economic metric for 
estimating the recovery of capital as a series of payments. The CRF, 
given by Eq. (4), is used to convert capital expenses into a series of 
annual payments [66], where i stands for the discount rate, and N is the 
investment period or lifetime of the project. 
CRFi×1iN
1iN 1(4) 
Subsequently, the levelized cost of electricity for a utility-scale PV 
system can be expressed as a function of hardware costs and installation 
costs, as shown in Eq. (5), where H stands for hardware costs, CRF is the capital recovery factor, I0 stands for the installation costs, and θ is the 
fraction that represents the yearly operating and maintenance costs. 
It is important to note that the concept of the levelized cost of elec-
tricity is widely used to evaluate and compare the economic feasibility of 
investments in power systems and assess the cost effectiveness of 
different energy sources and technologies. It reflects the “minimum 
price at which energy must be sold for an energy project to break even ” 
[67,68]. In utility-scale PV projects, the LCOE typically excludes factors 
such as land costs, tax reliefs, and other parameters related to the local 
context. This aspect is particularly important for utility-scale PV projects 
because investors often do not own the land where the installations are 
situated. Instead, they lease the land, creating a complex ownership 
structure with a lack of uniform accounting standards. This complex 
ownership structure makes it challenging to directly factor these costs 
into the LCOE and compare them across projects or regions [69]. 
Consequently, the inclusion of these parameters into the LCOE is typi-
cally done for specific investments with available ownership and cost 
data, rather than for evaluating the overall capacity and generation 
potential of a region of interest [70].

The proposed computational framework has a wide range of appli -
cations and can be adapted to examine and assess various geographical 
areas. As previously indicated, the method comprises two key compo -
nents. The first component entails a land eligibility analysis using a GIS- 
based tool, whereas the second component focuses on the techno- 
economic analysis of electricity generation in utility-scale solar PV 
systems. The universality and versatility of the first component stems 
from its reliance on publicly available datasets, which are detailed in 
Tables 1 and 2. This allows for customization when applying the method 
to different case studies. Consequently, researchers and practitioners 
interested in utilizing the method in other regions can adjust or replace 
the vector datasets, raster datasets and exclusion criteria to better align 
with the local context, resources, and policies. 
The second component, which focuses on the techno-economic 
assessment of utility-scale solar PV systems, relies on established 
financial concepts, such as capital investment costs, operational and 
maintenance costs, and the levelized cost of electricity. These concepts 
are widely used in academic studies and analyses conducted by 
governmental and intergovernmental organizations. They can be 
transformed into formulas that are adaptable to various case studies by 
modifying factors like investment and operational costs, interest rates, 
and capacity factors to align with local conditions. It is important to note 
that this study does not take into account land costs, lease costs, tax 
reliefs, and other local parameters. This exclusion is made to maintain 
the universality of the proposed method and facilitate the comparative 
analysis across the administrative divisions of the investigated area.

8The computations were executed on the Ares supercomputer hosted 
at the Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet AGH. The Ares supercom -
puter is one of the fastest high-performance computing (HPC) clusters in 
Poland, with a peak performance of 3.51 PFlops, 37,824 computing 
cores, and 147.7 TB of RAM [72]. The execution times on multiple 
worker nodes ranged from 900 s to 3600 s, depending on the exclusion 
criteria applied, spatial resolution, and size of the NUTS-2 region. 
3.Case study 
The applicability of the method is demonstrated through the case 
study of Poland, situated in Central Europe, as shown in Fig. 3. 
Depending on the region, the country experiences a daily total global 
horizontal irradiation ranging from 2.03 to 3.08 kWh/m2 [73]. Based on 
data spanning over 40 years, the average yearly irradiation ranges from 
1017 to 1124 kWh/m2, with a significant difference between southern 
and northern regions [74]. The highest solar potential is observed in the 
southern regions, while this potential gradually decreases towards the 
north. According to the Koppen-Geiger-Photovoltaic climate classifica -
tion system, Poland is categorized under the Cfb class, which denotes a 
warm temperate climate (C) that is fully humid (f) with warm summers 
(b) [75]. It is important to note that in previous years, Poland was 
classified as having a warm summer humid continental climate (Dfb). 
However, due to climate changes, the primary climate is now classified as warm temperate instead of continental [76,77]. 
Poland serves as an example to examine the viability of utility-scale 
photovoltaics in areas with average insolation and historical reliance on 
fossil fuels, where solar PV systems would play a key role in the energy 
transition towards the zero-emission power system in the long term 
[78]. Currently, nearly 75% of the total installed photovoltaic capacity 
comprises small-scale systems or rooftop micro-installation. Nonethe -
less, the Polish PV market is expected to shift from micro-installations to 
utility-scale systems in the upcoming years [79]. As a result, there is a 
need for advanced tools and comprehensive technical analyses that 
focus on land eligibility and the spatial distribution of solar energy in-
stallations, which can assist in decision-making processes at govern -
mental and intergovernmental levels. 
The evolution of solar photovoltaic capacity in Poland is shown in 
Fig. 4. Substantial growth in solar PV capacity has been observed in the 
last four years, reaching over 11 GW and accounting for approximately 
18% of the country ’s total installed capacity [80]. In 2022, it was esti-
mated that nearly 8.2 GW corresponds to small-scale installations, 
which accounts for 75% of the total solar power capacity [81]. This 
significant increase in small-scale installations has been primarily driven 
by the governmental support mechanism “My Electricity ” and tax reliefs 
offered to private owners of PV systems. Another crucial support 
mechanism for larger PV investments has been the Renewable Energy 
Source (RES) auctions, which establish reference prices of electricity for

9upcoming years. Under this system, auctions are held for each source 
individually, with separate auctions conducted for capacities below and 
above 1 MW. The current reference prices were set at around $90/MWh 
for solar PV installations below 1 MW and at $85/MWh for others. Note 
that in recent years, the auctions have cleared at higher prices than the 
average wholesale electricity sold in the day-ahead market. The instal -
lation capacity that benefited from this mechanism was 5329 MW as of 
2021 [82]. 
These incentives have provided additional funding and accelerated 
the development of the local photovoltaic market, surpassing the policy 
objectives set by 2040. The Polish Energy Policy projects a rise in solar 
capacity to 5.1 GW by 2035 and 9.8 GW by 2040 [83], which was 
already achieved in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
Poland is also one of the largest providers of solar photovoltaic 
employment in Europe. In 2021, the solar sector provided 113,000 jobs, 
which accounted for 24% of all solar jobs in the European Union [84]. 
Over 90% of these jobs came from small-scale rooftop installations built 
within the abovementioned support mechanisms. In the coming years, 
Poland is expected to maintain its position among European PV market 
leaders through jobs provided by utility-scale PV systems. However, the 
share of jobs in rooftop installations is expected to decrease by around 
45% in 2026 [84]. 
Globally, the average levelized cost of electricity generated from 
solar PV installations was around $0.048/kWh in 2021, with the 5th and 
95th percentiles of all projects ranging from $0.029 to $0.120/kWh 
[63]. Recent studies in Poland indicate that the levelized cost of elec-
tricity produced by small-scale solar photovoltaic systems varies from 
€0.14 –0.18/kWh [85], which ranks Poland among the countries with 
the highest levelized cost of electricity from solar PV. Due to the early 
development stage of utility-scale installation in Poland, accurate and 
available data about the levelized costs of electricity in those facilities 
are not yet publicly available. However, a study analyzing the case of 
Germany, which experiences comparable insolation levels, revealed that 
the levelized cost of electricity of solar PV utility-scale systems ranged 
from around €0.03 to €0.06/kWh [86]. 
In this context, the data employed to estimate the LCOE of utility- 
scale PV installations in Poland were acquired from multiple sources 
(Table 2). Hardware costs (H) of the systems were assumed to be 
€545.6/kW. These costs were calculated using the detailed breakdown 
of utility-scale solar PV installed costs reported for Poland in [63] and 
the average cost difference between fixed-tilt and one-axis tracking on 
ground-mounted racking systems (approximately 8.4%) reported by the 
U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [9]. The detailed 
breakdown of installed costs and cost difference between racking sys-
tems can be found in Tables A1-A2, presented in Appendix A. The dis-
count rate (i) was set at 5.92% based on the estimates reported for 
Poland in [61,87]. A conservative lifetime expectation (N) of twenty-five 
years was adopted, taking into account the results from a survey of U.S. 
Solar industry professionals [69]. Additionally, the fraction that repre -
sents the yearly operating and maintenance costs (θ) was set at 1%, 
based on a recent study focused on solar energy costs in over twenty 
European Countries [61]. 
4.Results 
This section provides an overview of the outcomes obtained using 
the proposed computational method for conducting a geospatial 
assessment of utility-scale photovoltaic installations in Poland. First, the 
section shows the results of the land eligibility assessment at the national 
and NUTS-2 level. Second, it describes the country ’s installable capacity 
and solar energy potential while accounting for different land use effi-
ciency factors. Finally, it compares the levelized cost of electricity of 
utility-scale solar systems throughout the seventeen Polish NUTS-2 
regions. 4.1. Land eligibility for utility-scale photovoltaic systems 
The utilization of the SILICON model, which integrates twenty 
exclusion constraints (detailed in Section 2), facilitates the computation 
and derivation of the land eligibility outcomes for utility-scale PV in-
stallations in Poland. These calculations were executed at a spatial res-
olution of 100 m across the seventeen Polish NUTS-2 regions (the names 
of regions are listed in Appendix C). The computations were carried out 
iteratively, using raster datasets obtained from overlaying land exclu -
sion constraints. Figs. 5a-h illustrate the results, which vary depending 
on the specific land exclusion criteria applied. 
Firstly, power lines and other transmission elements were excluded, 
which resulted in 4.33% of the total territory being ineligible for utility- 
scale PV systems (Fig. 5a). These outcomes are consistent with the lo-
cations of electricity transmission and distribution lines, power plants, 
and heating power plants. The most significant exclusions are in regions 
PL22 and PL51, where the largest number of power grid components and 
elements are situated. Secondly, areas with elevations above 2000 m and 
slopes above 30•were designated as unsuitable. This, combined with the 
power lines and other transmission elements, increased the ineligible 
land to 4.73% (Fig. 5b). This step primarily excluded the southern part 
of the country, where mountainous terrain is prevalent. Thirdly, 
continuous and discontinuous urban fabrics were set as ineligible areas, 
resulting in 27.75% of the land being excluded (Fig. 5c). This exclusion 
is particularly pronounced around major urban centers, where the 
availability of space for utility-scale solar PV systems diminishes 
significantly. Fourthly, constraints associated with commercial areas, 
industrial zones, port areas, dump sites, construction sites, sport and 
leisure facilities, green urban areas, and buffer distances to roads, rails, 
and airports were employed. This expanded the total ineligible area in 
Poland to 30.49% (Fig. 5d). The exclusions of these areas resulted in the 
removal of urban centers as viable locations for the potential deploy -
ment of utility-scale solar PV installations. 
In the subsequent step, regions characterized by broad-leaved, 
coniferous, and mixed forests were designated as ineligible, resulting 
in the exclusion of 72.84% of the total land (Fig. 5e). It is important to 
emphasize that the exclusions of forested areas represent the most 
substantial reduction in potential sites for utility-scale PV installations. 
These findings arise from the extensive coverage of forested regions in 
Poland, a characteristic influenced by the climatic conditions of the 
country. When water courses, water bodies, coastal lagoons, estuaries, 
sea, non-irrigated arable land, and permanently irrigated land are 
excluded, 93.34% of the total land is classified as ineligible (Fig. 5f). 
These exclusions further reduce the available land for utility-scale solar 
PV systems, primarily due to the considerable presence of water bodies 
in Poland. Constraints related to bird and habitat-protected areas in-
crease excluded land to 95.00% (Fig. 5g). This environmental constraint 
is of paramount importance, given that environmental clearance is often 
not granted in regions inhabited by protected species. Lastly, the areas of 
national and international importance designated by the European 
Environment Agency result in the exclusion of 96.39% of the land 
(Fig. 5h). 
As a result, only 3.61% of the total area is eligible for the potential 
deployment of utility-scale PV systems, equivalent to 11,277.70 km2 
(please refer to Table B.1 in Appendix B for detailed outcomes of each 
NUTS-2 region). These outcomes are consistent with the findings of 
Ryberg et al. [34], who investigated the land eligibility of pan-European 
countries. Note that Ryberg et al. estimated the total available land for 
open-field PV in Poland at 11,478 km2 but did not provide specific land 
eligibility values at the NUTS-2 level. This represents a 1.75% difference 
between the results in this study and those reported by Ryberg et al. In 
contrast, the computations performed using the SILICON model provide 
detailed results at both the national and administrative subdivision 
levels. 
Figs. 6 and 7 present the area of land available and excluded in each 
NUTS-2 region (the detailed model outcomes are provided in Table B.2 P.

11in Appendix B). The results show that more than half of the eligible land 
is concentrated in four regions. The largest available land is in PL92, 
covering 2046.2 km2, which represents 6.95% of the total region area 
and approximately 18.1% of all eligible land in Poland. The NUTS-2 
regions PL71, PL81, and PL84 each have around 1200 km2 of land 
eligible for solar utility-scale installations, constituting approximately 
around 11% of the total available land in the country. In terms of each 
region ’s area, the eligible land areas make up 6.75%, 6.18%, and 5.05% 
in PL71, PL84, and PL81, respectively. Despite the southern regions 
having the highest global horizontal irradiation, the results indicate that the most favorable areas, considering land constraints, are primarily 
located in the central and western parts of the country. This is due to 
significant exclusions in the south, associated with the presence of 
mountains and forests. 
4.2. Installable potential of utility-scale solar PV 
In addition to investigating the different aspects of land eligibility 
limitations in Poland, this study also estimates the installable capacity 
and electricity generation potential of utility-scale solar photovoltaics in

12Poland. To do this, two factors of land use efficiency were adopted. First, 
the study examined the land-use efficiency of 35 MW per square kilo-
meter, which is a conservative assumption for practical implementation 
and corresponds to the 95th percentile of the global average land-use 
efficiency of utility-scale photovoltaic systems [63,88]. Second, the 
analysis assumed an increase in land use efficiency to 50 MW per square 
kilometer [89]. This value reflects the average land-use efficiency of 
existing and ongoing utility-scale PV installations in Poland [90–92] and 
is close to the global average land use reported in the literature [63]. 
The potential installable capacity of utility-scale solar PV systems 
across the entire country ranges from 394.64 to 563.77 GW, depending 
on the land use efficiency factor employed in the calculations. Taking 
into account the capacity factors and technical characteristics of PV 
installations, these values can be translated into 51.4 to 73.4 TWh/year. Fig. 8 shows the potential installable capacity and electricity generation 
for each region. Of the total installable capacity in the country, 51.35% 
can be allocated to four central-western regions (PL71, PL81, PL84, and 
PL92), of which almost 20% is located in one region (PL92). Even in the 
region with the smallest area of land available (PL43), the potential 
installable capacity ranges from 4.07 to 5.82 GW, which translates to 
0.52 –0.74 TWh of renewable electricity, depending on the land use ef-
ficiency factor. 
Cameron and van der Zwaan investigated the employment factors for 
solar energy technologies and indicated that the number of jobs created 
from operation and maintenance costs in solar photovoltaic installations 
ranges from 0.1 to 1.65 jobs/MW, with an average number of 0.3 jobs/ 
MW [93]. When these values are taken into account, the development of 
utility-scale solar systems could create approximately 118,416 to

13169,167 jobs in Poland. The region with the greatest potential for job 
creation is PL92, where employment associated with utility-scale solar 
installations may amount to 21,486 –30,693 jobs. 
4.3. Levelized cost of electricity 
In addition to assessing the capacity and electricity generation po-
tential of solar PV systems, the SILICON model allows for the compu -
tation of the levelized cost of electricity in each cell representing the 
area with a resolution of 100 m within the analyzed country or region. 
The formulas given in Section 2.1.2 incorporate various techno- 
economic parameters that aid in analyzing the levelized cost of elec-
tricity generated by utility-scale solar PV installations. The LCOE is 
calculated by considering capital (CAPEX) and operating (OPEX) ex-
penditures, as well as the long-term yearly power potential of a cell 
eligible for the deployment of utility-scale PV systems. By leveraging 
widely accepted financial concepts, the SILICON model can be adapted 
for application in diverse countries and regions. 
The developed model was applied to a case study focused on Poland. 
The results, depicted in Fig. 9, indicate that the LCOE is higher in the 
northern regions and gradually decreases in the southern areas of 
Poland. This observed pattern aligns with the distribution of solar re-
sources and the corresponding fluctuations in renewable capacity fac-
tors across the country. 
The LCOE values range from €0.043/kWh to €0.049/kWh, which are 
comparable to those found in previous studies. Out of the seventeen 
NUTS-2 regions that were analyzed, the lowest LCOE values are 
observed in seven regions: PL21, PL22, PL51, PL52, PL72, PL81, and 
PL82. 
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 
the global weighted average LCOE of utility-scale solar PV projects is 
$0.048/kWh, with the 5th percentile at $0.029/kWh and the 95th 
percentile at $0.120/kWh. However, it is expected that the LCOE will 
decrease to $0.02 –0.08/kWh by 2030, depending on the isolation and 
geographic position of the system [94]. Considering Poland ’s insolation 
and location in the northern hemisphere, the LCOE throughout the 
country (€0.043 –0.049/kWh) falls within reasonable ranges with 
countries that experience similar levels of insolation. However, the 
recent decrease in investment costs has led to a global reduction in the 
LCOE, which is taken into account in this study and reflected in the 
slightly lower LCOE values. 
Furthermore, the results of this study are consistent with the lev-
elized cost of electricity of utility-scale photovoltaic systems in Germany 
($0.031 to $0.057/kWh) —which received comparable levels of solar 
insolation [63]. Kost et al. [86] estimated that the LCOE of utility-scale 
PV installations is less than €0.06/kWh in northern Germany and below 
€0.045/kWh in the southern part of the country. 
Fig. 10 displays the ranges of the LCOE in each NUTS-2 region of 
Poland. The results are presented in the form of boxplots, which provide 
information on the minimum, maximum, median, first, and third 
quartiles of the LCOE. Crucial insight can be derived from the median, 
first, and third quartiles of the LCOE values. The median values range 
from €0.043/kWh in PL72 to €0.047/kWh in PL42, with an average of 
€0.045/kWh. The first quartile of the LCOE ranges from €0.043/kWh to 
€0.046/kWh, while the third quartile ranges from €0.044/kWh to 
€0.047/kWh. It is worth noting that the differences within the regions of 
Poland are minimal. This is consistent with the capacity factors observed 
at this latitude and geographical location. 
The lowest values are observed in the southeastern part of the 
country, specifically PL21, PL72, PL81, and PL82. These results are 
consistent with the higher insolation in the aforementioned regions, 
resulting in higher capacity factors for utility-scale solar PV. Conversely, 
the highest LCOE values are observed in PL42 and PL63, corresponding 
to the northwestern part of Poland, where the insolation is the lowest. 
Although the ranges between the regions vary, the difference be-
tween the maximum and minimum LCOE values is only €0.006/kWh. Therefore, taking into account the marginal difference in the LCOE, it is 
advisable that land exclusion criteria and cost of financing should be 
prioritized during the planning and investment decision-making pro-
cesses of utility-scale photovoltaic systems in Poland. 
Fig. 11 presents a histogram that shows the range of LCOE values for 
utility-scale solar photovoltaic installations in Poland. The histogram 
provides a visual representation of the dispersion of the LCOE values 
across the country. As previously mentioned, the levelized cost of elec-
tricity can differ significantly by region, spanning from €0.042 to 
€0.049/kWh. The tails of the distribution are thin, suggesting that the 
values are concentrated around the mode. Most observations cluster 
within the €0.044 –0.045/kWh range, indicating that in regions with 
suitable land for utility-scale solar, one may generally expect these levels 
of LCOE. Moreover, the shape and skewness of the histogram suggest 
relatively low variability in the plausible values of the LCOE across all 
seventeen NUTS-2 regions. 
5.Conclusions 
This paper addresses the significant problem of spatio-temporal land 
use and cost distribution of solar technologies. It proposes an innovative 
method for analyzing land eligibility and conducting techno-economic 
assessments of utility-scale photovoltaic systems. The effectiveness of 
the method was tested through the geospatial analysis of the Polish 
territory and its seventeen NUTS-2 regions, a country heavily reliant on 
coal. The method contributes to the literature by proposing a GIS-based 
model that accounts for variations in the levelized cost of electricity due 
to labor-related costs such as PV system installation, mechanical and

14electrical installation, and other expenditures. 
The developed model was able to estimate that 3.61% of the total 
area of Poland is available for installing utility-scale solar PV systems, 
corresponding to 11,277.70 km2. The deployment of PV installations in 
these areas would facilitate the achievement of solar capacities ranging 
from 394.64 to 563.77 GW, depending on the land use efficiency. By 
taking into account the irradiation in Poland and the technical param -
eters of current PV technologies, these capacities can be translated into 
51.4 –73.4 TWh of renewable electricity. Considering the electricity 
consumption in Poland, which was 174 TWh in 2021, utility-scale PV 
installation could cover a significant share of this demand. Furthermore, 
it was found that most of the suitable sites for the deployment of utility- 
scale PV systems are concentrated in four regions located in the central 
and western parts of Poland (Ł˘odzkie (PL71), Lubelskie (PL81), Pod-
laskie (PL84), and Mazowiecki (PL92)). These regions account for more 
than 50% of the total capacity and electricity production potential. 
Additionally, region PL92 represents around 20% of the installable ca-
pacity potential. Consequently, investments in these four regions may 
substantially benefit the development of solar capacities and the 
fulfillment of Poland ’s renewable goals. This study is significant as it is 
the first that offers a comprehensive assessment of the installable ca-
pacity and electricity generation potential of utility-scale solar photo -
voltaics in the 17 Polish NUTS-2 regions, considering different land use 
efficiencies. 
The results of this study indicate that the levelized cost of electricity 
in Poland ranges from €0.043/kWh (PL72) to €0.049/kWh (PL22), with 
a national average of €0.045/kWh. The highest values are observed in 
the northern regions, whereas the lowest are in the southern regions. 
The southern regions have the highest irradiation levels and capacity 
factors, which may enable utility-scale systems to achieve higher annual 
electricity production compared to regions located in the central and 
northern parts of the country. However, despite the lower cost, the 
southern regions exhibit lower land eligibility values than the central 
regions. Some paths for future research include assessing other renew -
able energy technologies in Poland and investigating the impact of large- 
scale battery energy storage on the competitiveness of renewable 
technologies. 
Overall, this study provides an advancement towards the develop -
ment of GIS-based tools for planning and modeling renewable energy 
systems. Although the approach was tested for the case of Poland, the 
computational method is versatile and could be used for the develop -
ment of national and regional strategies focused on large-scale PV in-
stallations and to fulfill renewable energy goals at the lowest cost in 
other countries, regions, and locations. 
Future research will aim to enhance the capabilities of this tool to 
facilitate the techno-economic assessment of rooftop utility-scale in-
stallations and wind farms. This will involve accommodating adjusted 
land constraints and integrating new geospatial datasets. Additionally, 
the GIS-based method is planned to support spatio-temporal analyses of 
potential green hydrogen installations. 
This study primarily focuses on the evaluation and comparison of 
techno-economic aspects associated with utility-scale solar photovoltaic 
systems. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. 
Firstly, the study does not take into account the variable land costs in 
specific geographic locations, tax reliefs schemes, and other factors 
closely tied to the local context. Consequently, a comprehensive un-
derstanding of the total costs of electricity generation in diverse regions 
may necessitate further analyses that incorporate all relevant cost 
components unique to some locations. Secondly, it is also worth noting 
that investment projects are susceptible to risks related to social 
acceptance. Therefore, for a more holistic assessment of solar PV po-
tential, it is advisable to supplement the GIS-based tool employed in this 
study with decision-making methods such as the Analytic Hierarchy 
Process or similar techniques. These additional methods can provide 
valuable insights into the broader spectrum of factors influencing the 
deployment and sustainability of utility-scale solar PV projects. Funding
